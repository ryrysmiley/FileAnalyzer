## File Analyzer

[FileAnalyzer Website](https://fileanalyzer.netlify.app)<br></br>
Client side file analyzer to view file metadata and review file extensions.

## Extra Notes

The file extensions may not be 100% accurate as there are exceptions to the rule and the database is from 2023. Maximum file size is 25MB to not crash the client side.
